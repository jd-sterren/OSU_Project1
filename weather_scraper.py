NOTES: The data abstracted only has the time for the search date.  The time is
affected by daylight savings and as such, will return 11:51 PM as the start to
the day.  Outside the savings time, the data will show 12:51 as the start to
the day.
If you haven't installed selenium use pip install selenium, else, use updates

pip install selenium --upgrade
pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager

-- USE SMALL DATA CHUNKS PERHAPS ONE OR TWO MONTHS AT A TIME --
The website likes to create pop up ads which can cause the driver to freeze.
